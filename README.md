# iFusion

### [Project Page](https://chinhsuanwu.github.io/ifusion) | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17250)

This is the official implementation of [iFusion](), a framework that extends existing single-view reconstruction to pose-free sparse-view reconstruction by repurposing [Zero123](https://github.com/cvlab-columbia/zero123) for camera pose estimation.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chinhsuanwu/ifusion.git
cd ifusion
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Download Zero123-XL and place it under `ldm/ckpt`
```bash
cd ldm/ckpt && wget https://zero123.cs.columbia.edu/assets/zero123-xl.ckpt
```

## Usage

Create an image directory that contains at least 2 images. Images can be preprocessed through
```bash
rembg i input.png output.png
```
Run demo by specifying the image directory
```bash
python main.py data.image_dir=asset/sorter
```
You should see a NeRF-style `transform.json` in the same folder as the output of the pose optimization and `lora.ckpt` after the sparse-view fine-tuning stage. Qualitative visualization of novel view synthesis is shown at `demo.png` as follows. Please refer to `config/main.yaml` for detailed hyper-parameters.
